#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The wile loop needs to be run n times adding n**2 each time (n * n**2 = n**3) to reach break.


b)  O(nlog(n)) i (outer loop) will loop n times, each time j (inner loop's iterator) has to be multiplied 

    by 2**(log(n)) to reach n thus the inner loop has to be run log(base 2)(n) times to reach break, making 

    the total runtime n*log(n)



c)O(n)(or O(bunnies)) the recursion will be repeated n times before base case is reached and the outer call is returned.
